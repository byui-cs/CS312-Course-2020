"""
Instructions:

- You will impliementing the following functions using Opencv
- The first step is to make sure that you have OpenCV for Python installed
- You a free to use any images for the function below (except task 5)
  - Download images from the Internet
  - Use your own photos
- You must download "usa.png" from the GitHub repo for task 5

def task2():
    """ Task2: Open image and flip left <-> right """

    # 1) Try doing this task using loops and just the numpy array once you load the image

    # 2) Use OpenCV function(s)

    print('Task 2')



def task3():
    """ Task3: Open image and flip up <-> down """

    # 1) Try doing this task using loops and just the numpy array once you load the image

    # 2) Use OpenCV function(s)

    # Do this task using loops and just the numpy array once you load the image
